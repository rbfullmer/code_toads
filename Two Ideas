Here are the ideas from our group which made it to this point.

Neighborhood Watch - I'm sure we'll come up with a catchy name for this online web application, but in the meantime, 
let me describe it's purpose and design. I was thinking we could call this Z.A.P. (Zimmerman Application)

Here, based upon your street address, and by invitation, users are grouped together into their street, circle, 
or "corner of the woods" if you will. There, you can set up notifications, email groups, and allow the other 
users in your group (neighborhood) message you. If there was an emergency or if someone noticed something 
suspicious, the user who noticed who press one button and an alert would be sent to the group. Then, after the 
issue was either resolved or called off, a follow up message would be sent. There could be a calender and 
announcement board. The users could of course decided what type and frequency of notifications they desire.

Hotel Management Software - This application would be used to manage the rooms, upgrades, orders, and everything 
else hotel related. We could add modules as needed, to include orders of supplies and other management only pieces, 
but it would start with the simple management of room available.
